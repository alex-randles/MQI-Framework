# MQI-Framework
The Mapping Quality Improvement (MQI) Framework designed to improve and maintain the quality of R2[RML\] mappings. 

**Published Framework**

The framework is published online at the following link:

<https://mqi-framework.adaptcentre.ie>

Two ontologies are used to represent the graphs generated by the framework. 
The Mapping Quality Improvement Ontology (MQIO) is used to represent the mapping 
quality reports. The Ontology for Source Change Detection (OSCD) is 
used to represent source data changes. 
Online documentation is available for both ontologies:

**MQIO:** <https://w3id.org/MQIO>

**OSCD:** <https://w3id.org/OSCD>
