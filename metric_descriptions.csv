METRIC ID,METRIC NAME,METRIC DESCRIPTION
MP1,"Valid language datatype
definition","Objects maps with literal 
values may refer to only one 
datatype and no language tags"
MP2,Valid term type definition,"The term type for a Subject map must be 
an rr:IRI or an rr:BlankNode"
MP3,Valid term type definition,"The term type for a Predicate map must 
an rr:IRI"
MP4,Valid term type definition,"The term type for an object map must be an 
rr:IRI, rr:Literal or an rr:BlankNode"
MP5,Valid subject definition,"Subject definitions must be valid
URIs unless its type is defined as
blank node"
MP6,Valid literal language tags,"Valid language tags are 
defined as per RFC 5646 
(BCP 47) language tags"

D1,"Usage of undefined
classes ","Classes are
considered undefined when it is
not possible to dereference them
against their namespace"
D2,"Usage of undefined
properties ","Properties are
considered undefined when it is
not possible to dereference them
against their namespace"
D3,Usage of incorrect Domain,"The class type defined in the subject map 
does not  include the domain for this property "
D4,No query parameters in URI's,"The use of query parameters is not
parameters in recommended by the W3C 
best practices for URIs"
D5,"No use of entities as
members of disjoint classes","Individuals of one class cannot be
simultaneously members
of another class"
D6,Usage of incorrect Range,"The term type for this property does not 
match the range. A literal type is inferred for column-value term maps."
D7,Usage of incorrect datatype,"The datatype assigned to the object does not 
match the datatype range for this property "
